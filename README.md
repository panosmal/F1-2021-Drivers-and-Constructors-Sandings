# Ranking 2021 F1 drivers and constructors with PageRank algorithm

In this project we use the PageRank (PR) algorithm to rank Formoula 1 drivers and constructors for 
season 2021. The points system employeed to get the final standings can be found here.

The project consists of a Jupyter notebook with all the code and outputs as well as the dataset (F1 RACES 2021) we used.
