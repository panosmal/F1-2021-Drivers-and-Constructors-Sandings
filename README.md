# Ranking 2021 F1 drivers and constructors with PageRank algorithm

In this project we use the PageRank (PR) algorithm to rank Formoula 1 drivers and constructors for 
season 2021. The point system employeed and ranking method to get the final standings can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456068/?fbclid=IwAR2s-hNbPMKRDEe1zDP7_A3wIDV0qvPLRQVfq5mxiCHqYRAgxw6EdSinrM8).

The project consists of a Jupyter notebook with all the code and outputs as well as the dataset (F1 RACES 2021.xlsx) we used.
